# Changelog

This file documents the changes made to the formatter with each release.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added `--verbose` option to print one line per formatted file (#227)
- Added an `index` sub-command that writes a machine-readable index of GDScript declarations, references, member chains, string literals, comparisons and comments to stdout as JSON Lines, for tools that need source positions the engine cannot give them. See `docs/specification_index.md`
- `index`: every member chain segment now reports its `kind` (`identifier`, `self`, `call`, `node_path`, `subscript`, `other`) and whether it is a call, so a consumer resolving a chain hop by hop knows where to stop instead of mistaking `$Clock.text` for a member of the enclosing script
- `index`: added `--project-root <PATH>`, and a run now refuses to mix `res://` paths with file system paths rather than silently producing paths a consumer cannot join on
- `index`: `reference` and `member_chain` records carry `argument_of`, so nested calls report their argument position without re-parsing argument text
- `index`: `class` declarations and the `file` header report `extends`, the base as written, so a consumer can work out which script a compile failure really came from without scanning the source itself
- `index`: constructors are now indexed. `_init` is an anonymous keyword in the grammar, so the name lookup never found it and every constructor was missing from the output
- `index`: annotations written on the line above a declaration now bind to it, so an own-line `@abstract` reports `modifiers: ["abstract"]` like the same-line form always did. Previously they were dropped. Annotations that belong to no declaration, such as `@tool` above a bare `extends`, are emitted as their own `annotation` record
- `index`: `context` reports `condition` for every expression tested for truth, including both operands of `and` and `or` and the operand of `not`, so a method named but never called in `if flag and self.predicate:` is now distinguishable from an ordinary expression. Parentheses no longer change any context

### Changed

- Removed space between lambda function name and parameter list
- Force @export and @onready annotations to stay on the same line as a variable but keep other annotations separate
- Stop trying to format any code containing parse errors. Until now we tried to still format definitions around the code with errors, but this can lead to cases where the formatter produces invalid code
- Add line wrapping for annotation arguments (#330)

### Fixed

- Fixed an extra comma being inserted after a trailing comment in a lambda function argument (#304)
- fixed certain export annotations being moved out of their respective groups (#308)
- Preserve up to one blank line used to group elements in "containers" like enums
- Fixed losing blank line between statements in a body if the previous statement has an inline comment (#320, thanks @Buitragox for the fix)
- Fixed various edge cases with ignored directories: paths are now normalized before comparison
- Fixed special get syntax with parentheses having an extra space (#314)
- Output warnings to stderr when using reorder and safe mode together (#332)
- Removed the space between `...` and variadic parameter names (#331)
- Fixed incorrect indentation for match patterns using `and` or `or` (#328)

## Release 0.24.0 (2026-07-25)

### Added

- You can now exclude files and folders using the `--exclude/-x` flag or `gdscript_formatter_exclude` in your editorconfig files (#299)

### Fixed

- Fixed edge case when a lambda is at the end of an argument list and ends with a match statement, causing the formatter to insert a trailing comma (#301)
- Fixed a case of a long function definition that would not wrap on multiple lines despite being a little over 100 characters (#300)
- Fixed a multiline argument in a function call that's not at the end of a chain of function calls forcing explicit line continuations for the rest of the chain (#298)


## Release 0.23.0 (2026-07-24)

### Added

- Handle Tree-sitter parse errors gracefully, preserve declarations with parse errors while formatting valid code around them (#279)

### Changed

- Force short lines that were manually wrapped on multiple lines with commas to merge back into one line when they fit within the max line length (this behavior was a leftover from the old formatter implementation)
- Changed editor settings for safe and reorder mode; they're now a single format mode
- Deprecated `--safe` flag, renamed into `--verify-structure`

### Fixed

- Fix type casts with type subscripts wrapping when placed at the end of long lines (e.g. `[long, array] as Array[SomeType]`)
- Fix icon annotation being reordered below class_name when extends was before class_name (#295)
- Godot addon: Fix error when running the formatter with both safe and reorder mode active; they're now mutually exclusive in the editor settings (#286)

## Release 0.22.2 (2026-07-22)

### Fixed

- Fix long ternaries without pre-existing backslashes or delimiters formatting in a way that GDScript doesn't parse (the formatter will now add parentheses around the expression and indent it) (#293)
- Fix non-parenthesized lambda can lead to a parse error when not parenthesized or followed by other arguments (#292)
- Fix max_line_length in .editorconfig ignored when linting (#272)


## Release 0.22.1 (2026-07-22)

- Fixed is not being lost in a parenthesized expression (#284)
- Fixed conditional expression keyword detection to avoid breaking after `if`/`else` keywords (#291)

- Godot addon: Fixed performance issues when typing on Steam version of Godot (#262)

## Release 0.22.0 (2026-07-21)

### Added

- Added a profiling option to the benchmark script compatible with the samply profiler

### Changed

- Implemented new balanced line wrapping algorithm for long chains of expressions, including operations and boolean expressions
- In chains of properties and method calls, the formatter will now try to preserve chains like a.b.c with long argument lists or nested lambdas. It will favor breaking the arguments in parentheses over breaking the chain into multiple lines
- Specified the definition for continuation lines and changed function calls and other statements and expressions to use a single extra indent instead of two by default
- Always force lambda functions to have a line return after the function declaration, like regular functions

### Fixed

- Conditions that exceed max-line-length by only a few columns get backslash + attribute-dot wrapping instead of the parenthesized and-wrap used for larger overflows (#270)
- Fixed --reorder-code detaches trailing comments from top-level declarations and re-attaches them above the following declaration (#271)
- Fix empty lines removed between conditional blocks (#276)
- Fix editorconfig ignored when running from stdin (#275)
- Fix code getting modified/comments getting mangled with operators in multiline chains of binary operator expressions (#278)
